                        <p class="card-text">Although the English definition of "Shareek" is "sharing," in Punjab it has always meant something very different. One doesn't even realize how and when the brothers turn against one another as time passes. When brothers get together, their offspring become cousins. However, in Punjab's medieval system, the term "cousins" refers to "shareeks," while "shareeks" refers to "enemies." The cousins would engage in a bloody conflict about who would control a larger plot of property. This phenomena has been causing harm for ages and has never ceased. With all of its love, romance, excitement, and action, the movie "Shareek" confronts this threat head-on, however subtly.
